# minix
Fork of MINIX sources - To Create MINOX Unhackable OS for NOX immutable hardware.
The existing Minix3 development is the property of a University. 

It is open source and if you want to help them, you can contribute code. We will contribute code when appropriate.

The project MINIX3 as owned has set forth a road map. That road map is appropriate for the mission of the organization that owns MINIX3.

The Unhackable project has a different mission and to accomplish that mission we must make a radical divergence from that road map.

We are designing an operating system for CPU's that are yet to exist.  

True Unhackability may not be possible with existing mutable hardware.

We are creating our own ARM derivative CPU to meet these needs and the future chip may have cores dedicated to kernel operation.

This is not so radical of an idea when you realize millions of chips made today have a core dedicated to MINIX now.

There is a difference between a Textbook and a Research Paper. 

Minix is a textbook operating system. 

Minox is a high risk high reward leap into the future.

We are a research laboratory, not a classroom.

We are a high risk venture capital enterprise, not a university.
